    <p><strong>Cooking</strong> or <strong>cookery</strong> is the art, technology,
      science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption.
      Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world,
      from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves,
      to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic,
      and cultural traditions and trends.</p>
    <p>Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks.
      Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional
      cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
      Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat,
      such as in ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with
      the acids in lemon or lime juice or orange juice.</p>
    <p>Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans.
      It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence
      for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.</p>
    <p>The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between
      civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients.
      New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding
      and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced
      scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.</p>

      <li>Once it starts boiling - about 3 to 5 minutes after placing it on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the rice is done.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and add the sliced Tomato and Onions, and stir together briefly. Then, cover it up immediately so that the heat remaining in the Rice can steam up the vegetables a little bit.</li>

          <td><p>Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as "pulp" in American English, and "(juicy) bits" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as "OJ".</p></td>
